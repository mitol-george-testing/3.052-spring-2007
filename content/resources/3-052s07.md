description: 'This 3D illustration of a modulus map of bone was produced using atomic
  force microscope (AFM) data on the nanomechanical spatial heterogeneity of bone
  stiffness. Simulations using this data predict markedly different biomechanical
  properties compared with a uniform material, which may serve as a design consideration
  for biologically inspired materials technologies. See Tai, K., M. Dao, S. Suresh,
  A. Palazoglu, and C. Ortiz. "Nanoscale Heterogeneity Promotes Energy Dissipation
  in Bone." Nature Materials 6 (June 2007): 454-462. (Image courtesy of Prof. Christine
  Ortiz.)'
