description: 'For homeworks 2 and 5, the supporting WSxM image files (hw2_wsxm_nanoparticle.txt
  and hw5_wsxm_chondrocyte.txt) are for use with free Nanotec WSxM software. This
  file format starts with an ASCII variable size header followed by the binary data
  of the image. You may open the file with an ASCII editor like Notepad and see the
  header of the file, but caution: do not try to save that file from the ASCII editor
  because it will destroy the binary data!'
